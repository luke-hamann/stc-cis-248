# Navigation

![The navigation bar](./images/navigation.png)

The navigation bar lives at the top of every page in the application.
It allows you to navigate between the major portions of the app.

* [Schedule](./6_schedule.md) - For schedule editing
* [Team Members](./3_team_members.md) - For working with team members you can put on the schedule
* [Shift Contexts](./4_shift_contexts.md) - For working with the shift contexts that time slots can live in
* [Colors](./5_colors.md) - For working with saved color swatches that can be applied to schedule notes

On narrow screens, the navigation will collapse into a hamburger menu, (&equiv;).
You can click or tap on this to view the navigation buttons.
