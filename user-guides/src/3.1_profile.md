The team member profile page allows you to view a team member's basic profile
information, edit the team member, or delete the team member.

## Profile

The team member profile page displays all the basic profile information for a
team member.

The tabs navigate to the following locations:

- The "Profile" tab will display the profile information for a team member (this
  page).
- The "Preferences" tab will allow you to view and edit the team member's shift
  context preferences.
- The "Availability" tab will bring you to the team member's typical
  availability.
- The "Unavailability" tab will bring you to the team member's unavailability.

Clicking "Edit" will all you to edit the team member's basic profile
information. Clicking "Delete" will send you to a confirmation to delete the
team member.

## Team Member Edit

The team member edit page allows you to edit a team member's basic profile
information. It works very similarly to the
[team member add page](./3_team_members.md#team-member-add).

If you click "Save" with valid data, the form will update the team member's
information and bring you back to their profile. If you click "Save" with
invalid data, the form will display errors that it will allow you to correct.
You can then attempt to save again. Clicking "Cancel" will discard your changes
and return you to the team member's profile.

## Team Member Delete

The team member delete page confirms that you want to delete a team member.

Clicking "Yes" will delete the team member and return you to the
[team member list page](./3_team_members.md#team-member-list). Clicking "No"
will cancel the deletion and return you to the team member's profile.

Warning: Deleting a team member will mark time slots they have been assigned to
as unassigned. They will also be removed from daily substitute lists.
