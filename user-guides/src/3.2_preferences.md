# Team Member Preferences

![The team member shift context preferences page](./images/preferences.png)

The team member preferences page allows you to change a team member's shift
context preferences.

For each shift context, you have three options to select from:

- The first column (sad face) indicates the team member perfers not to work in
  the shift context.
- The second column (neutral face) indicates the team member has not expressed a
  preference regarding the shift context.
- The third column (happy face) indicates the team member prefers to work in
  this shift context.

Clicking "Save" will save your changes and return you to the team member profile
page. Navigating away from the page will discard your changes.
