# Team Member Preferences

![The team member shift context preferences page](./images/preferences.png)

The team member preferences page allows you to change a team member's shift
context preferences.

For each shift context, you have three options to select from:

1. ☹️ (sad face) - Indicates the team member prefers not to work in the shift
   context
2. 😐 (neutral face) - Indicates the team member has not expressed a preference
   regarding the shift context
3. 🙂 (happy face) - Indicates the team member prefers to work in this shift
   context

Clicking "Save" will save your changes and return you to the team member profile
page. Navigating away from this page will discard any changes.
