# Team Member Availability

The team member availability pages allows you to edit when a team member is available during a typical week.

Note that when a team member is marked typically available at a given time, but they are also marked [unavailable](./3.4_unavailability.md), the team member is considered unavailable.

## Team Member Availability List

The availability list page shows time slots the team member is availabile, grouped and ordered by day of the week.

If a team member is not available on a given day of the week, the day of the week will show "(none)".
Otherwise, the availability time slots will be listed under the day of the week.

Clicking the plus button next to a day of the week will allow you to create an availability time slot for that day of the week.

An availability time slot card includes some information and buttons.

* The start and end times for the availability slot on the given day are printed on the left.
* The icon in the middle indicates whether this availbility slot is preferable.
  * A happy face means the availability is preferable.
  * A sad face means the availability is not preferable.
* Clicking the pencil icon will allow you to edit that availability slot.
* Clicking the red "x" icon will bring you to a confirmation form to delete the availability slot.

## Team Member Availability Add

The availability add page allows you to create an availability slot for a team member.
Here, you can enter:

* The day of the week of the typical availability (Sunday through Saturday)
* The start time of the slot
* The end time of the slot
* Whether the availability is preferable

(All fields are required.)

If you enter valid data and click "Save", the availability slot for the team member will be saved, and you will be sent back to the availability list page. If your data is invalid, the form will display errors and allow you to correct them.

Clicking "Cancel" at any point will discard your data and return you to the availability list page.

## Team Member Availability Edit

Clicking "Cancel" at any point will discard your changes and return you to the availability list page.

## Team Member Availability Delete
