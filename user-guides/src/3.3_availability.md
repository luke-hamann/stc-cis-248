# Team Member Availability

The team member availability pages allow you to edit when a team member is
available during a typical week.

Note: [Unavailability](3.4_unavailability.md) _overrides_ a team member's
typical availability.

## Team Member Availability List

The availability list page shows time ranges when a team member is available,
grouped and ordered by day of the week and then ordered by time.

If a team member is not available on a given day of the week, the day of the
week will show "(none)". Otherwise, the availability slots for the team member
on that day will be listed.

Clicking the plus button (+) next to a day of the week will allow you to create
an availability slot for the team member on that day of the week.

An availability time slot card includes some information and buttons:

- Start and end time (left) - The time range for the availability slot on the
  given day
- Face icon (middle) - Indicates whether the availability slot is preferable
  - üôÇ (happy face) - Indicates the availability slot is preferred
