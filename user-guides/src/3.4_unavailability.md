# Team Member Unavailability

The unavailability section of the team member pages allow you to specify dates
and times a team member is unavailable.

Note: Unavailability _overrides_ a team member's
[typical availability](./3.3_availability.md).

## Team Member Unavailability Year

The team member unavailability tab will bring you to an unavailability calendar
for the current year.

The top of the calendar displays its year. Clicking the year to the left of the
center year will show the calender for the prior year. Clicking the year to the
right of the center year will show the calendar for the next year.

The calendar is arranged by month, showing all days within each month. The
current date will also be highlighted within the calendar.

Clicking on a date in the calendar will bring you to the team member's
unavailability list for the week containing that date.

## Team Member Unavailability Week

The unavailability week page lists a team member's unavailability slots for a
given week. It works similarly to the
[team member availability list](3.3_availability.md#team-member-availability-list).

The buttons near the top have the following functions:

- Week header - Sends you to the unavailability calendar page for the year the
  week starts in
- Left angle bracket (<) - Sends you to the team member's unavailability list
  for the previous week
- Right angle bracket (>) - Sends you to the team member's unavailability list
  for the next week
- Clear button - Asks to confirm the deletion of all unavailability slots for
  the team member within the current week

Unavailability slots are grouped and ordered by date and then ordered by start
time. If a date does not have unavailability slots, the section will be marked
with "(none)".

Each unavailability slot card contains some information and buttons to work with
the unavailability:

- Start and end time (left) - The time range of the unavailability slot
- Face icon (middle) - Indicates whether the unavailability slot is preferable
  - üôÇ (happy face) - Indicates the unavailability slot is preferred
  - ‚òπÔ∏è (sad face) - Indicates the unavailability slot is not preferred
- ‚úèÔ∏è Pencil button (right) - Allows you to edit the unavailability slot
- ‚ùå Red "x" button (right) - Asks to confirm the deletion of the unavailability
  slot
