The unavailability week page lists a team member's unavailability slots for a week.

The buttons near the top have the following functions:

* Week header - Sends you to the unavailability calendar year page for the year the week starts in
* Left angle bracket - Sends you to the team member's unavailability for the previous week
* Right angle bracket - Sends you to the team member's unavailability for the next week
* Clear button - Opens a form to confirm you want to delete all the team member's unavailability slots for the week

Unavailablity slots are grouped and ordered by date, and then ordered by start time.
If a date does not have unavailability slots, the section will be marked with "(none)".

Each unavailability entry contains the following:

* Left: The start time and end time of the unavailability
* Center: An icon indicating the team member's preference for the unavailability
  * A smiley face means the team member might be willing to be called in at the time.
  * A sad face face means the team member is definitely unavailable.
* Right: Buttons for modifying the unavailability slot
  * Clicking the pencil icon will open a form for editing the unavailability slot.
  * Clicking the red "x" icon will open a form to confirm you want to delete the unavailability slot.
