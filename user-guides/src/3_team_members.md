# Team Members

The team members section allows you to save information about your team members.
This includes:

* [Profile information](3.1_profile.md) - Basic information about the team member
* [Shift context preferences](3.2_preferences.md) - What shift contexts the team member prefers to work in
* [Availability](3.3_availability.md) - When the team member is usually available
* [Unavailability](3.4_unavailability.md) - Special times the team member is definitely unavailable

## Team Member List

![The team member list page](images/team_member_list.png)

The team member list page shows all the team members you have saved.
The top portion lists regular members of your team, ordered by last name and then first name.
The bottom portion lists potential workers as external resources that are not ordinarily scheduled.

Each of the buttons have the following features:

* The "Add" button allows you to create a new team member.
* The "Profile" button for a team member will take you to their basic profile information.
* The "Preferences" button for a team member will take you to their shift context preferences.
* The "Availability" button for a team member will take you to their typical availability information.
* The "Unavailability" button for a team member will take you to their special unavailability.

## Team member add

![The team member add page](images/team_member_add.png)

The team member add page allows you to create a team member.
Here, you can enter their basic [profile information](./3.1_profile.md):

* First name
* Middle name
* Last name
* Birth date
* Email address
* Phone number
* External - Whether the team member is an external resource
* Max weekly hours - The maximum number of hours per week you want the team member to work
* Max weekly days - The maximum number of days per week you want the team member to work

Note that only first name, last name, and birth date are required.

Clicking "Save" with valid profile information will create the team member and bring you to their profile. If your data is invalid, the form will display errors that you can correct. You can then try saving again. Clicking "Cancel" will discard the data you entered without creating a team member, and you will be brought back to the team member list page.

After creating a team member's profile, you typically want to also specify their [availability](./3.3_availability.md) before adding them to a schedule, and possibly also specify times they will be [unavailable](./3.4_unavailability.md).
