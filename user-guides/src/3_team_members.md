# Team Members

The team members section allows you to save information about your team members.
This includes:

- [Profile information](3.1_profile.md) - Basic information about a team member
- [Shift context preferences](3.2_preferences.md) - What shift contexts the team
  member prefers to work in
- [Availability](3.3_availability.md) - When the team member is usually
  available
- [Unavailability](3.4_unavailability.md) - Special times the team member is
  unavailable

## Team Member List

The team member list page shows all team members you have saved. The top portion
lists regular members of your team, ordered by last name and then first name.
The bottom portion lists external workers that are not ordinarily scheduled.

Each of the buttons have the following features:

- [Add](#team-member-add) - Create a new team member
- [Profile](3.1_profile.md) - View a team member's basic profile information
- [Preferences](3.2_preferences.md) - View a team member's shift context
  preferences
- [Availability](3.3_availability.md) - View a team member's typical
  availability information
- [Unavailability](3.4_unavailability.md) - View a team member's special
  unavailability

## Team member add

![The team member add page](images/team_member_add.png)

The team member add page allows you to create a team member. Here, you can enter
their basic [profile information](./3.1_profile.md):

- First name
- Middle name
- Last name
- Birth date
- Email address
- Phone number
- External
- Max weekly hours
- Max weekly days

"External" describes whether the team member is an external resource and is not
ordinarily scheduled. "Max weekly hours" defines the maximum number of hours per
week you want the team member to work. "Max weekly days" defines the maximum
number of days per week you want the team member to work.

Only first name, last name, and birth date are required.

Clicking "Save" with valid profile information will create the team member and
bring you to their profile. If the information is invalid, the form will display
errors that you can correct. You can then try saving again. Clicking "Cancel"
will discard the information you entered without creating a team member, and you
will be brought back to the [team member list page](#team-member-list).

After creating a team member's profile, you typically want to also specify their
[availability](./3.3_availability.md) and possibly also times they will be
[unavailable](./3.4_unavailability.md).
