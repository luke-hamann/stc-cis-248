# Colors

The colors section allows you to create and save color swatches for use on time
slot notes and daily shift context notes.

## Color List

![The color list page](images/color_list.png)

The color list page shows all the note colors you have saved.

The first row underneath the header allows you to create a new color. You can
click on the black square to open a color picker and select a color. You can
then type in a name for the new color. Clicking on the blue plus icon (+) with
valid information will create the color and keep you on this page. If the
information is invalid, you will be sent to the [color add page](#add-color) to
correct the errors. Clicking on the red "x" icon in this row will clear the
form.

Both the color and name are required. Every color must have a unique name.

Below the first row, your saved colors are listed alphabetically by name. Each
row includes:

- A square that shows the color swatch
- The color's name
- A pencil button (✏️) to edit the color
- A red "x" button that asks for confirmation to delete the color

## Edit Color

The edit color page allows you to edit a color. The fields include:

- Name
- Color

Both fields are required. The name must also be unique.

Clicking "Save" with valid information will save the updated color and return
you to the [color list page](#color-list). If the information is invalid, the
form will show errors you can correct. You can then attempt to save again.

Clicking "Cancel" will discard any changes and return you to the
[color list page](#color-list).

Warning: Changing the color itself will affect all notes that have been assigned
this color.

## Add Color

The add color page will appear if you enter invalid information in the miniature
add color form on the [color list page](#color-list). It works similarly to the
[color edit page](#edit-color). You can correct the errors and save to create
the new color, or you can cancel.

## Delete Color

![The color delete page](images/color_delete.png)

The color delete page allows you to confirm the deletion of a color.

Clicking "Yes" will delete the color and return you to the
[color list page](#color-list).

Clicking "No" will cancel the deletion and return you to the
[color list page](#color-list).

Warning: If you delete a color, all notes assigned the color will be marked
colorless.
