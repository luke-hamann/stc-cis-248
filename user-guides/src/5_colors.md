# Colors

The colors section allows you to create and save color swatches for use on time
slot notes and daily shift context notes.

## Color list

The color list page shows all the colors you have saved.

The first row underneth the header allows you to create a new color. You can
click on the black box to open a color picker and select a color. You can then
type in a name for the new color. Clicking on the blue plus icon will create the
color. Clicking on the red "x" icon in this section will clear the form.

If you do not enter a valid color, you will be sent to the
[add color](#add-color) page.

Below the first row, your saved colors are listed. Clicking on a pencil icon
allows you to edit a color. Clicking on a red "x" icon will allow you to confirm
the deletion of a color.

## Edit color

name of the color. You can also click the color picker to change the color.

Clicking "Save" will save the updated color and return you to the color list
page. Clicking "Cancel" will discard any changes and return you to the color
list page.

Note: Colors must have a unique name.

this color

## Add color
