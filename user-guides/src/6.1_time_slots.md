# Time Slots

The time slot pages allow you to manage everything about individual time slots, including their context, date, time, assignee, and note.

## Time Slot Add

The time slot add page allows you to create a new time slot.

### Basic Section

The "Basic" section of the form requires basic information about the time slot:

* The shift context
* The date
* The start time
* The end time
* Whether the time slot requires an adult

Only the shift context, date, and times are required.

### Assignee Section

The "Assignee" section allows you to mark a time slot as unassigned or as assigned to a team member.

While you make changes to the Basic section of the form, the "Assignee" section will automatically update with assignee recommendation notifications.

Each consideration column in the table means the following:

* Adult - Whether the time slot requires an adult, and the potential assignee is an adult
* Typically available - Whether the potential assignee is typically available during the date and time of the time slot
* Not marked unavailable - The potential assignee is not marked unavailable during the date and time of the time slot
* Prefer - The potential assignee prefers the shift context of the time slot
* No conflicts - The potential assignee has not been scheduled during another time slot happening at the same time
* Not external - The team member has not been marked as an external resource

In the table, the symbols have specific meanings for the consideration:

* Hyphen (➖) - Neutral / Applicable
* Question mark (❓) - Unknown
* Red "X" (❌) - Negative
* Green check mark (✅) - Positive

For example, if a time slot requires an adult, but the date and time have not been specified, it is not possible to determine whether a team member would meet the age requirement.

### Note Section

The "Note" section allows you to optionally add a note and note color to the time slot.

You can also create and use a new color on the note:

1. Select the radio button next to the bottom, "new" color option.
2. Click on the black rectangle within the option.
   This will open a color picker to pick the new color.
3. Enter a unique name for the color in the "new" text box.

When you successfully save the time slot, the color will be created and applied to the time slot note.

### Save and Cancel

Clicking "Save" with valid data will create the time slot and send you to the schedule week of the newly created time slot.
If you enter invalid data, the form will display errors that you can correct.
You can then attempt to save the time slot again.

Clicking "Cancel" at any time will discard the data you have entered and return you to the schedule week.

## Time Slot Edit

The time slot edit page allows you to edit an existing time slot.
It works similarly to the [time slot add page](#time-slot-add).

## Time Slot Delete

The time slot delete page allows you to confirm the deletion of a time slot.

Clicking "Yes" will delete the time slot and send you to the original schedule week of the time slot.

Clicking "No" will cancel the deletion and send you to the original schedule week of the time slot.
