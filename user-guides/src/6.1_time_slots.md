# Time Slots

The time slot pages allow you to manage everything about individual time slots,
including their context, date, time, assignee, and note.

## Time Slot Add

![The time slot add page](./images/time_slot_add.png)

The time slot add page allows you to create a new time slot.

Note: Some links in the application pre-populate most of this information for
you under certain conditions, such as
[new time slot buttons](6_schedule.md#shift-contexts-and-time-slots). It is also
possible to bulk copy time slots using the
[copy time slots page](6_schedule.md#copy-time-slots).

### Basic Section

The "Basic" section requires basic information about the time slot:

- Shift context
- Date
- Start time
- End time
- Whether the time slot requires an adult

Only the shift context, date, and times are required.

### Assignee Section

The "Assignee" section allows you to assign the time slot to a team member (or
leave the time slot unassigned).

While you make changes to the ["Basic" section](#basic-section), the "Assignee"
section will automatically update with assignee recommendation details. Each row
corresponds to a potential assignee (e.g. a team member). Each column represents
a status relating the potential assignee with the given time slot:

- Adult - Whether the potential assignee meets the time slot's age requirements
- Typically available - Whether the potential assignee is typically available
  during the time of the time slot
- Not marked unavailable - The potential assignee is not marked unavailable
  during the time of the time slot
- Prefer - The potential assignee prefers the shift context of the time slot
- No conflicts - The potential assignee has not been scheduled during a
  concurrent time slot
- Not external - The team member is not an external resource

Symbols at the intersection of team member rows and status information columns
indicate whether the team member meets the status condition:

- Hyphen (➖) - Neutral / Non-Applicable
- Question mark (❓) - Unknown
- Red "X" (❌) - Negative
- Green check mark (✅) - Positive

For example:

- Suppose a time slot does not require an adult. The "Adult" status for every
  team member will be neutral/non-applicable because there is no age
  requirement.
- Suppose a time slot requires an adult, but the time slot's date and time have
  not been specified. The "Adult" status for every team member will be unknown
  because while there is an age requirement, the age of any team member at the
  time of the time slot cannot be calculated.
- Suppose a time slot requires an adult, and the time slot's date and time have
  been specified. The "Adult" status for every team member will be positive or
  negative depending on whether they meet the age requirement at the time of the
  time slot.

### Note Section

The "Note" section allows you to optionally add a note to the time slot. The
fields include:

- Note - The content of the note
- Color - The color of the note

You can also create and use a new color for the note:

1. Select the radio button next to the bottom, "new" color option.
2. Click on the black rectangle within the option. This will open a color picker
   for selecting the new color.
3. Enter a name for the color in the "new" text box. The name must be unique.

When you successfully save the time slot, the new color will be created and
applied to the time slot note.

### Buttons

Clicking "Save" with valid information will:

1. Create the time slot
2. Redirect you to the
   [schedule week editor](6_schedule.md#schedule-week-editor) for the week
   containing the new time slot
3. Bold the cell containing the new time slot and scroll to it in the schedule
   week table

If the information is invalid, the form will display errors you can correct. You
can then attempt to save the time slot again.

Clicking "Cancel" at any time will discard the information and return you to the
[schedule week editor](6_shedule.md#schedule-week-editor).

## Time Slot Edit

![The time slot edit page](./images/time_slot_edit.png)

The time slot edit page allows you to edit an existing time slot. It works
similarly to the [time slot add page](#time-slot-add).

## Time Slot Delete

![The time slot delete page](./images/time_slot_delete.png)

The time slot delete page allows you to confirm the deletion of a time slot.

Clicking "Yes" will delete the time slot and redirect you to the week within the
[schedule week editor](6_schedule.md#schedule-week-editor) that originally
contained the time slot.

Clicking "No" will abort the deletion and redirect you to the week within the
[schedule week editor](6_schedule.md#schedule-week-editor) that contains the
time slot.
