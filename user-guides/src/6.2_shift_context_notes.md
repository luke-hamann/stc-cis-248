# Shift Context Notes

![The shift context note edit form](./images/shift_context_note.png)

The shift context note edit page allows you to edit the note for a shift context
on a given date.

The shift context and date are read-only. The other fields include:

- Color - The color of the note
- Note - The content of the note

Clicking "Save" will save the note and redirect you to the week within the
[schedule week editor](6_schedule.md#schedule-week-editor) containing the note.
Saving a note without color or content is equivalent to deleting the note.

Clicking "Cancel" will discard your changes and redirect you to the week within
the [schedule week editor](6_schedule.md#schedule-week-editor) where the note
would have been saved.
