# Shift Context Notes

![The shift context note edit form](./images/shift_context_note.png)

The shift context note edit page allows you to edit the note for a shift context on a given day.

The date is read-only and states what date the note is for.
Below that, you can choose a color for the note and then enter the content of the note.

Clicking "Save" will save the note and send you to the schedule week containing the note.

Clicking "Cancel" will discard your changes and also send you to the schedule week containing the note.
