# Substitutes

![The substitutes edit page](./images/substitutes.png)

The substitutes edit page allows you to specify the substitutes for a given day.

The date is read-only and specifies what day the substitute list is for. Below
that, you can use the checkboxes to select which team members you want on the
substitute list for that day. (You are not required to select any team members.)

Clicking "Save" will save your changes and return you to the schedule week
containing the updated substitute list.

Clicking "Cancel" will discard your changes and also return you to the schedule
week containing the original substitute list.
