# Substitutes

![The substitutes edit page](./images/substitutes.png)

The substitutes edit page allows you to specify the substitutes on a given date.

The date is read-only and indicates what date the substitute list is for. The
checkboxes allow you to select which team members you want on the substitute
list for the date. (You are not required to select any team members.)

Clicking "Save" will save your changes and redirect you to the week within the
[schedule week editor](6_schedule.md#schedule-week-editor) containing the
updated substitute list.

Clicking "Cancel" will discard your changes and redirect you to the week within
the [schedule week editor](6_schedule.md#schedule-week-editor) containing the
original substitute list.
